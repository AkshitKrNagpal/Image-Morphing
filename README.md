# Image-Morphing

## Description

The aim of the project was to study and implement image processing techniques and writing MATLAB functions to experiment with your own image.

## Implementation 

The following image manipulation effects were implemented were implemented - 

1.  Wave Effect
2.  Oil Painting Effect
3.  Warm Tone Effect
4.  EYE Effect
5.  Grayscale Effect
6.  Solarization Effect

In additon to these, using concept used in "EYE Effect" a generalized method was made to manipulate image. The image was manipulated according to any function f(x) by defining f(x) and range for plotting f(x).
